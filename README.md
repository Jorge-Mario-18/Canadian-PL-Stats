Candaian Premier League Center Circle Data

The Canadian Premier League is the top tier of Men's football/soccer in Canada excluding MLS which has three franchises in Canada. 

In this repository I used the data provided from CPL to demonstrate shots to goals conversion rate. 
I'm also attempting to demonstrate the effectivness of goals inside the box vs outside of the box.

Please don't hesitate to tell me any suggestions on how I may improve! Thank You!
