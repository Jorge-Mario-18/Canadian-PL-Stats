Candaian Premier League Center Circle Data

The Canadian Premier League is the top tier of Men's football/soccer in Canada excluding MLS which has three franchises in Canada.

In this repository I used the data provided from CPL to demonstrate goals to shots conversion rate.

I'm also attempting to demonstrate the effectiveness of goals inside the box vs outside of the box.

All the work is done in RStudio and I have also provided two charts "Shots in the box vs out the box" & "Conversion Rate"

CPL Team Totals 2019.csv is the data set provided by the Canadian Premier League.

Please don't hesitate to tell me any suggestions on how I may improve! Thank You!
