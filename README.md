Candaian Premier League Center Circle Data

The Canadian Premier League is the top tier of Men's football/soccer in Canada excluding MLS which has three franchises in Canada.

In this repository I used the data provided from CPL to demonstrate goals to shots conversion rate.

I'm also attempting to demonstrate the effectivness of goals inside the box vs outside of the box.

I do not make any claims or come to any conclusion. I am merely showing that I can properly visulize and communicate the data provide.

All the work is done in RStudio and I have also provided two charts "Shots in the box vs out the box" & "Conversion Rate"

CPL Team Totals 2019.csv is the data set provided by the Canadian Premier League.

Please don't hesitate to tell me any suggestions on how I may improve! Thank You!
